[00:19.33] I saw you lookin' like a diamond in the rough
[00:23.58] I told myself that one night ain't enough
[00:27.53] Then we started talkin, I mean stalkin'
[00:29.80] Lips are locking, remove your stockings
[00:31.92] For me and you girl, one life ain't enough
[00:35.63] But time, is our best friend
[00:39.59] You blow my mind from the beginning to the end
[00:43.87] Our stars aligned, and now your future is mine
[00:46.55] Girl, your future is mine, girl your future is mine
[01:12.05] 
[00:52.19] When the sun comes up, our future's what I'm seeing
[00:56.63] When sun goes down, that's when you start believing
[01:00.87] That your only world it could be mine,
[01:03.56] all that I need is time
[01:05.25] When the sun comes up, that's when I get the feeling
[01:08.53] Girl your future is mine
[01:20.53] 
[01:09.55] Face it girls I've seen 2001,
[01:13.44] Still wearing the same things from the 2001!
[01:17.70] But you seemed different, how you living
[01:19.86] You'll handle the business, when I make you my Mrs.
[01:21.88] I can't believe our story's just begun
[01:25.61] 'Cause time is our best friend
[01:29.68] You blow my mind, from the beginning to the end
[01:34.15] Our stars aligned, and now your future is mine
[01:38.21] Girl, your future is mine, girl your future is mine
[02:03.71] 
[01:42.73] When the sun comes up, our future's what I'm seeing
[01:46.81] When sun goes down, that's when you start believing
[01:51.27] That your only world it could be mine,
[01:53.59] all that I need is time
[01:55.39] When the sun comes up, that's when I get the feeling
[01:58.39] Girl, your future is mine
[02:10.89] 
[02:00.92] One night ain't enough
[02:03.63] From crystal balls to disco balls and we go more
[02:06.48] Until we fall in love
[02:09.16] One life ain't enough
[02:11.84] So, just forget about the past
[02:14.00] 'Cause the future is where it's at
[02:31.00] 
[02:16.19] When the sun comes up, our future's what I'm seeing
[02:20.32] When sun goes down, that's when you start believing
[02:24.49] That your only world it could be mine,
[02:27.05] all that I need is time
[02:28.82] When the sun comes up, that's when I get the feeling
[02:31.81] Girl, your future is mine
[02:44.31] 
[02:43.52] Your future, your future
[02:48.49] Your future is mine
[02:52.97] Your future is mine
[03:02.47] 
[03:07.15] When the sun comes up
[03:08.74] (Girl, you'll be mine)
[03:10.81] When sun goes down
[03:13.45] (Girl, you'll be mine)
[03:24.45] 
[03:15.30] When the sun comes up, our future's what I'm seeing
[03:27.18] When sun goes down, that's when you start believing
[03:31.26] That your only world it could be mine,
[03:33.78] all that I need is time
[03:35.74] When the sun comes up, that's when I get the feeling
[03:38.68] Girl, your future is mine
